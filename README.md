# 📊 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** branch!  
This branch is completely focused on learning and mastering **DSA concepts**, without using any specific programming language.  
The goal is to understand the **logic**, **approach**, and **problem-solving strategies** behind every topic.
